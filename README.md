# tictactoe
project:  
-> build a tic tac toe game, playable in your browser  
-> allow for PvP or PvAI (easy or expert) game modes  
-> use minimax algorithm to build unbeatable AI  
  
  
-- happy to hear feedback! --  
  
happy with:  
-> staying the course, as this one challenged me (especially applying the minimax)  
-> minimal global variables  
-> css learnings (animation, @keyframes, transform)  
  
improvement ideas:  
-> alpha beta pruning. (wrestled with it for a long while but didn't figure it out) 
-> refactor code? (I have yet to get much feedback on my code, so I'm unsure if there are abundant opportunities to condense the code or if I'm on the right track for a newbie)
